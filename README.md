# Katalon Analytics Debian/Ubuntu package

https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/Upload+Reports

Currently, we're building packages only for Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, but they have been tested and known to work on other Debian and Ubuntu versions.

## Building packages
You can build packages yourself by running `make`. Requirements: `make` (obviously), `docker`, `sed`, `wget`. This will generate a `katalon-analytics-*.deb` file locally.

Building packages modifies some files in `package` directory, so please do not commit them - instead, commit your changes before building and reset after building.

## Using apt repository
These packages are published on apt.trys.eu. To use that repo, you first need to trust my gpg key:

```
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv B2902044AD3A8C3552B419C43616C413CFA7D784
```

Then install `apt-transport-https`:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
```

Finally create `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-trys-eu.list` with contents `deb https://apt.trys.eu/ /` and run `apt-get update`:

```
echo 'deb https://apt.trys.eu/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-trys-eu.list 
apt-get update
```

Testing: `apt-cache policy katalon-analytics | grep apt.trys.eu | head -n1` should show:

```
       500 https://apt.trys.eu  Packages
```

Note that this is not a dedicated repository for Docker Compose, nor an official one. I am in no way affiliated with Docker, just a poor man trying to make my life easier deploying and managing Docker Compose versions across hundreds or machines owned by separate entities. I recommend to use apt pinning to make sure that packages from this repo do not override packages from your system, except for `docker-compose` package (PRs on how to properly setup apt pinning are welcome, as well as for any other aspect of packaging). Use at your own risk.
